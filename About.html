		<p> Hello! My name is Brenden Woodside and I am currently a student at Armstrong Jr/Sr Highschool in Western Pennsylvania. Being a senior, life is filled with projects, homework, and college applications. Somehow I fit some of my favorite hobbies into the mix such as marching band, stage crew, and boy scouts. I see my self as a leader because of my experiences in scouting and stage crew. I am currently the manager of the left stage and a senior patrol leader in boy scouts. My time in scouting has brought me to many unique and wonderful places. Over the years I have hiked 80 miles in New Mexico and over 250 miles on the Baker trail and the Appalachian trail. Although the hikes seemed difficult at the time, I was able to bring back memories of a life time.
